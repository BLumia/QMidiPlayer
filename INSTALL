Use qmake or Qt Creator.

Dependencies:
> libfluidsynth 1.1.4+, Qt5 and RtMidi.

C++11 is required to build the project. Qt4 will not work without
several tweaks.

To build the default visualization plugin, you need the latest SMELT,
which can be found [here](https://github.com/BearKidsTeam/SMELT).
Some dependencies in the project file are hard-coded paths. You may
have to modify them first.
