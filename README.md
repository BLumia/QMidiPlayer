# QMidiPlayer
A cross-platform midi file player based on libfluidsynth and Qt.

Now it's in alpha stage. There are still a whole bunch of bugs, be careful...

Features:
* Channel mute/solo
* Editing channel parameters on-the-fly
* Playlists
* Editing synthesizer effects
* Rendering midi to wave file
* Visualization using SMELT (not implemented)

Tested on Debian sid. A few changes are required to make it work correctly on Windows.
