# QMidiPlayer
A cross-platform midi file player based on libfluidsynth and Qt.

Currently it's still very incomplete and not suitable for everyday use.

Planned features:
* Channel mute/solo
* Editing channel parameters on-the-fly
* Playlists (partially implemented)
* Editing synthesizer effects
* Visualization (not implemented)
* Rendering midi to wave file (not implemented)
