A cross-platform midi file player based on libfluidsynth and Qt.

Now it's in beta stage. Crashes and hangs may still occur, run with gdb attatched if you could.

Features:
* Channel mute/solo
* Editing channel parameters on-the-fly
* Playlists
* Editing synthesizer effects
* Rendering midi to wave file
* Visualization using SMELT (not implemented)
* MIDI mapping (experimental, based on RtMidi)

Tested on Debian sid and Windows Vista~10.

A QML version is now in construction. The whole project is now being overhauled...
