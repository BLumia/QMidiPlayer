# QMidiPlayer
A cross-platform midi file player based on libfluidsynth and Qt.

Now it's in beta stage. Crashes may still occur, ~run with gdb attatched if you could~.

Features:
* Channel mute/solo
* Editing channel parameters on-the-fly
* Playlists
* Editing synthesizer effects
* Rendering midi to wave file
* Visualization using SMELT (not implemented)

Tested on Debian sid. A few changes are required to make it work correctly on Windows.
